  NOTE THAT SUPPORT FOR DISABLED TESTS IS NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED IN DRIVER.

  How to disable certain test cases:

  If this file is test/lib/disabled-tests-dist.conf,
    then copy it to test/disabled-tests.conf

  Then edit the disabled tests lists below,
  in disabled-tests.conf, to include the 
  filenames of tests to skip.  For example:

  module.exports.disabledTests = {
    "integraltypes/QueryTableScanTest.js" : true
  };

**/

 
module.exports.disabledTests = {
  /* skipped tests go here: */
  
};
