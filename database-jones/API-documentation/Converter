/*   
   Converters convert between JavaScript types and database types.
   If a user supplies a converter, it will be used both when 
   reading and writing values to and from the database.

   Converters have several purposes:
    - To convert between MySQL DECIMAL types and a user's preferred JavaScript
      fixed-precision utility library
    - To convert between MySQL BIGINT types and a user's preferred JavaScript 
      big number utility library
    - To serialize arbitrary application objects into character or binary columns
    - To facilitate handling of DATETIME, TIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP     
    - To emulate the MySQL server's handling of SET and ENUM columns in 
       non-SQL adapters such as the ndb adapter
 
   A converter object implements two functions: 
      toDB(obj)  : convert obj, an application object, 
                   into the intermediate type representation of a column
      fromDB(val): convert val, an intermediate type,
                   into an application object form
   Each function explicitly returns the result of the conversion.   
   
   A TypeConverter registered by the user takes precedence over the adapter's 
   default converter for a type (if any).
   
   A fieldConverter registered as part of a TableMapping takes precedence over 
   any typeConverters.
